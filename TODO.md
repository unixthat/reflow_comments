# TODO for Reformat Print & Comment Tool

This document outlines potential improvements, new features, and ideas for future development of the Reformat Print & Comment Tool. Contributions and suggestions are very welcome!

---

## Installation & Build Improvements

- **Makefile:**
  - Create a robust `Makefile` to build the project.
    - Targets:
      - `all`: Compile with default flags.
      - `debug`: Compile with `-g` flag.
      - `clean`: Remove generated binaries and temporary files.
  - Include installation targets:
    - `install`: Copy binary to `/usr/local/bin/` (or configurable location).
    - `uninstall`: Remove installed binary.
- **Cross-Platform Support:**
  - Investigate building on different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows with MinGW/MSYS2).
  - Consider using CMake for more flexible cross-platform builds.
- **Dependency Checks:**
  - Automate checking for dependencies (like Black) during build or via a pre-build script.
  - Optionally bundle a version-check script.

## Documentation Improvements

- **README.md Enhancements:**
  - Include detailed usage examples and screenshots.
  - Add FAQ section covering common issues and troubleshooting tips.
  - Provide example output (before and after) for each rule.
- **API Documentation:**
  - Document each function in the source code with more detailed comments.
  - Generate API docs (if desired) using a tool like Doxygen.
- **User Manual:**
  - Create a separate user manual (PDF/HTML) with step-by-step instructions, configuration examples, and best practices.

## Feature Enhancements

- **Additional Formatting Options:**
  - Allow configurable maximum line length (instead of hardcoding 79).
  - Provide command-line flags to select which rules to apply (e.g., skip triple-quote reflow, or inline splitting).
- **Improved Heuristics:**
  - Use a more advanced parser for Python comments (possibly leveraging Pythonâ€™s own tokenizer via an external call) for better accuracy.
  - Fine-tune word-wrapping logic (e.g., allow user-specified break characters).
- **Error Handling & Logging:**
  - Improve error messages and logging (possibly with a verbose flag).
  - Generate a log file of changes made for review.
- **Backup & Dry-Run Options:**
  - Add an option to create backups of files before modifying them.
  - Include a dry-run mode that shows what changes would be made without writing to disk.

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Write unit tests for helper functions (e.g., `wrap_text()`, `rtrim()`, `ltrim()`) using a C unit testing framework.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Create test cases for sample Python files that cover all transformation rules.
  - Automate testing with a CI system (GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or CircleCI) to run tests on push.
- **Static Analysis:**
  - Integrate with tools like `cppcheck` or `clang-tidy` to ensure code quality.
- **User Feedback:**
  - Add a mechanism for users to submit bug reports or feature requests (link to GitHub issues).

---

## Code Refactoring & Cleanup

- **Modularization:**
  - Consider splitting the code into multiple source files (e.g., one for file processing, one for text transformation) for better maintainability.
- **Configuration File:**
  - Allow configuration of parameters (e.g., MAX_LEN, temporary file directory) via an external config file or command-line options.
- **Improve Memory Management:**
  - Audit the code for potential memory leaks.
  - Consider using a more robust dynamic string library if available.

---

## Other Useful Ideas

- **GUI Frontend:**
  - Develop a simple GUI wrapper (using, for example, Qt or GTK) for users who prefer not to use the command line.
- **Integration with Editors:**
  - Provide plugins or snippets for popular editors (e.g., Vim, VSCode) to trigger reformatting on save.
- **Documentation Website:**
  - Host project documentation on GitHub Pages for easy reference.
- **Internationalization:**
  - Add support for multiple languages in the error messages and logs.
- **Benchmarking:**
  - Measure the tool's performance on large repositories and optimize bottlenecks if necessary.
- **Extensibility:**
  - Provide a plugin or hook system that allows users to add their own transformation rules.
